[Prompt 1]
Instead of deleting the current encoder/decoder, move it to a separate file, like was done for convnextv2.py.

[Changes]:
* Restored the original convolutional encoder and visualization decoder in a dedicated `jepa_world_model/conv_encoder_decoder.py` module.
* Exposed legacy encoder/decoder aliases in the trainer alongside the ConvNeXtV2 defaults.
